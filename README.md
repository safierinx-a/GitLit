I'm trying to put together a system for generating and displaying LED patterns on addressable LED strips. The system will be designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy addition of new patterns and modifiers.

I'm using a Raspberry Pi to run the system and a USB audio interface to capture audio input.

End goal would be to have a home lighting system with a web control interface which is able to react to audio input/run standalone visuals. Patterns could be 1D or 2D.

See files in the [docs](docs) folder for more details.
